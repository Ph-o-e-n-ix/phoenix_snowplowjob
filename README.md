Hello Friends, today im Releasing an existing Script but edited and optimized as a V2. 
It has many Features and its very custamizable. For ESX and QB available
You need to drive around to get some Rewards in a Intervall (Time based). 
You can setup a min. and max. Speed so the People are driving slow to earn their Money, otherwise they will earn nothing

**Features**

* Add as many Stations as you want
* Configure a min. and max Reward each Intervall / Bonus
* Take Bail if needed
* Setup a Webhook
* Custom Snowprop (optional)
* Easy Notify Intergration
* configure min. and max. Speed for Driving
* supported oxtarget, qbtarget and 3DText
* For ESX and QBcore

I was doing this, because some people would drive that fast that this is not really realistic so you can simply
customize, that he can only drive up to 50 km/h , otherwise the timer will not run and he dont earn money.

And The SnowProps are not important for earn Money, its only visual.

You can also add your own vehicle in the Config so every Car is available.
